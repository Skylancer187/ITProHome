IT Professional Tools for Home Computers, Users and Troubleshooters

A collection of tools over the coarse of needs to help update, automate, secure home users, customers and/or those in need.

I work on a lot of computers for both professional, home, business and non-profit. I release these tools to the public in hope that it helps others. 
Please do not charge people for the use of these tools, but the time you spent on it. Or better yet, do some non-profit work and help those that can't get good technical assistance or support.

My professional career allows me to use various IDE and packagers, so I will try to release some EXE (packaged) versions of my code along with the source.
